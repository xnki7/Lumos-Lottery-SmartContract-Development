This is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that represents a lottery game. It allows players to buy a ticket for 1 ether and at any point in time, the manager can pick a random winner from the pool of players.

The contract has a state variable manager which stores the address of the account that deployed the contract. The players array is a dynamic array of type address payable that stores the addresses of all the players who have bought a ticket.

The buyTicket() function is a payable function that allows a player to buy a ticket for 1 ether by sending the transaction with a value of 1 ether to the contract. The require statement ensures that the correct amount of ether is sent with the transaction. If the correct amount is not sent, the transaction will be reverted and the ether will be returned to the sender.

The random() function is a private function that generates a random number based on the difficulty of the current block, the current timestamp, and the length of the players array. The pickWinner() function can only be called by the manager and it picks a random winner from the pool of players by generating a random index using the random() function. The winner is then transferred the balance of the contract, and the players array is reset to an empty array.

The getPlayers() function is a read-only function that returns the array of addresses of all the players who have bought a ticket. The restricted() modifier is a custom modifier that restricts access to certain functions only to the manager of the contract.
